Modern pollen data (smpdsv2_pollen_counts_amalgamated.csv; smpdsv2_metadata.csv) can be obtained from https://researchdata.reading.ac.uk/389/.
Fossil pollen data is ACER pollen data, which can be obtained from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.870865.
LOVECLIM temperature data (LOVECLIM temperature.nc) can be downloaded from http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/las/v6/dataset?catitem=0 by choosing Datasets > APDRC Public-Access Products > Paleoclimate modeling > LOVECLIM > Dansgaard-Oeschger > surface temperature, then selecting xyt volume, NetCDF file, Full Region, then click Next.
LOVECLIM seasonal albedo, snow depth and surface solar radiation can be obtained by contacting l.menviel@unsw.edu.au.
The modern data used to generate the model to compose/decompose albedo can be obtained by following the instructions in the Supplementary Table 1 in the paper "Rapid ice-age warming events amplified by strong vegetation-albedo feedback".
The timing is provided here as an zip file.
